## Project Details

This is a basic Desktop Application with Angular and Electron. Angular was used for the presentation of the recordings content. Recordings data is being read from localhost but the implementation allows easy loading from any cloud storage. For the statistics, D3.js was used both for the data manipulation and the potential use of charts.
